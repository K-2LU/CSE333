### 3.30 Consider the following SQL query on the university schema:
```
select avg(salary)-(sum(salary) / count(*))
from instructor
```
### We might expect that the result of this query is zero since the average of a set of numbers is defined to be the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. Indeed this is true for the example instructor relation in Figure 2.1. However, there are other possible instances of that relation for which the result would not be zero. Give one such instance, and explain why the result would not be zero.

### 3.31 Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the ID and name of each instructor who has never given an A grade in any course she or he has taught. (Instructors who have never taught a course trivially satisfy this condition.)

``` sql

### 3.33 Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the ID and title of each course in Comp. Sci. that has had at least one section with afternoon hours (i.e., ends at or after 12:00). (You should eliminate duplicates if any.)  
__Query:__
``` sql

### 3.34 Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the number of students in each section. The result columns should appear in the order “courseid, secid, year, semester, num”. You do not need to output sections with 0 students.

``` sql

### 3.35 Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find section(s) with maximum enrollment. The result columns should appear in the order “courseid, secid, year, semester, num”. (It may be convenient to use the with construct.)

``` sql
    WITH section_student_frequency(courseid, sec_id, year, semester, num)
